Hackercut
=========

**Hackercut** is a Chrome extension that powers full keyboard navigation of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).

I've just finished the development of this extension and it's going to be released in Chrome Extension store. But in the mean time, you can still use it under [Developer Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01).

After installing the extension, while on Hacker News website, press <span style="color:#23A600">*"?"*</span> key to bring up the instructions:

##Arrow Navigation
Arrow Navigation is the most powerful feature of this extension, you can go through the story links using just your up/right arrow keys and open/vote up/view author/view comments as you like.

Press <span style="color:#23A600">*"Tab"*</span> to turn on arrow navigation mode, you should see a green arrow to the left of the first link:
![arrow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zinanxing/Hackercut/master/screenshots/arrow.png "Arrow Navigation")

You can move the arrow up and down using your arrow keys, then you may choose to:

key press | function
--- | ---
<span style="color:#23A600">ctrl(&#8984;)+enter</span> | open current link in new tab
<span style="color:#23A600">v</span> | vote it up
<span style="color:#23A600">a</span> | select its submitter(which you can then use ctrl+enter to open in new tab)
<span style="color:#23A600">c</span> | select its comments

![arrow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zinanxing/Hackercut/master/screenshots/comments.png "Select comments")

And pressing "esc" key will turn off Arrow Navigation mode.

##Page Switching
Switching pages with **Hackercut** is just one key press away:

key press | function
--- | ---
<span style="color:#23A600">right arrow key</span> | next page
<span style="color:#23A600">n</span> | "newest" page
<span style="color:#23A600">m</span> | "comments" page*
<span style="color:#23A600">k</span> | "ask" page
<span style="color:#23A600">j</span> | "jobs" page*
<span style="color:#23A600">s</span> | "submit" page
<span style="color:#23A600">h</span> | Hacker News front page
<span style="color:#23A600">l</span> | "login" page

<pre>*</pre>arrow navigation does not work on "comments" and "jobs" pages at this moment.

I hope you can better enjoy Hacker News with <span style="color:#FF6600">**Hackercut**</span>.
